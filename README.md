## Traffic Monitoring from Dhaka Traffic Video
## Introduction
Traffic congestion is a major challenge in urban areas like Dhaka. Efficient traffic monitoring systems help in city planning, reduce congestion, and improve road safety. This project uses computer vision techniques to process a Dhaka traffic video, extract image frames, and prepare the dataset for further analysis such as vehicle detection, traffic density estimation, and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset was created from a Dhaka traffic video. Frames were extracted from the video at fixed intervals and stored in organized folders for easy processing.
Extracted frames are stored in:

data_video/extracted_frames

data_video/pulled_frames

The dataset is suitable for tasks such as vehicle detection, object tracking, and traffic analysis.

## Project Workflow
Load and read the Dhaka traffic video.

Extract frames at specific intervals to reduce redundancy and dataset size.

Organize the frames into separate folders for different purposes.

Prepare the extracted images for use in computer vision tasks.

## Results
Frames were successfully extracted from the Dhaka traffic video.

Dataset prepared for use in machine learning and computer vision applications.

The method can be extended to other traffic videos or used in real-time monitoring.

## Future Improvements
Integrate vehicle detection and counting using object detection models such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN.

Create traffic density heatmaps for visual analysis.

Deploy as a real-time monitoring dashboard for traffic management.
